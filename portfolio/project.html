                <h2>Multi Purpose Tracker</h2>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users can record their daily tasks and log the quantities or progress in respective columns,
                        making it easy to monitor their activities.</li>
                    <li>The application sends notifications and reminders to prompt users to complete their tasks,
                        ensuring they stay on track with their daily responsibilities.</li>
                    <li>Users can share their tracking templates with others, fostering collaboration and enhancing
                        productivity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This project aims to leverage the knowledge and experience I have gained
                    throughout my three years of university studies and workplace engagements to develop a functional
                    application.
                    Additionally, I seek to explore and integrate new technologies, such as Firebase for backend
                    services and Azure for cloud deployment, to further enhance my skills and adapt to industry
                    standards.</p>
